Example REPO for Issue: https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/issues/119

All you have to do is start it up,
it should setup a fake user, post,
and then use HTTP to attempt to:

1. login (works)
2. post to ValidatedMethod
 1. Method Validation (works)
 2. Method run (works)
 3. Collection before update hook (starts, but without the userId)
